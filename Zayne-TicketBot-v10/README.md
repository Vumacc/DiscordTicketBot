# Zaynedrift's Ticket Bot v1.0

This is extremely basic python code for a discord bot that can handle tickets on discord 

Please read main.py's notes to ensure the code runs correctly. 
.venv is here because this bot was programmed in Visual Studio Code with Python 3.11.6
Please avoid touching the venv files (it's not worth it trust me)
